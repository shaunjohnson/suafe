<h1>Authorization Files</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Suafe can read and write Subversion Authorization (authz) files, however,
comments are never saved. If your current authz file contains comments,
opening it up and saving it with Suafe will result in a file with no comments
(<a href="limitations.html">see limitations</a>).
</p>

<p>
Authz files are outputted in the following format. File contents are organized
alphabetically. For example, group definitions are organized by group name 
alphabetically, as well as group members are listed alphabetically.
</p>

<strong>&lt;document&gt;</strong>
<pre>
    "[group]"
    (&lt;group_definition&gt;)*
    (&lt;section_definition&gt;)*
</pre>

<strong>&lt;group_definition&gt;</strong>
<pre>
    &lt;group_name&gt; = (&lt;group_name&gt, )* (&lt;user_name&gt;)*;
</pre>

<strong>&lt;section_definition&gt;</strong>
<pre>
    ([&lt;relative_path&gt;]) | ([&lt;repository_name&gt;:&lt;relative_path&gt;])
    (&lt;access_rule&gt;)*
</pre>

<strong>&lt;access_rule&gt;</strong>
<pre>
    (&lt;group_name&gt;) | (&lt;user_name&gt;) = ("rw" | "r" | "")
