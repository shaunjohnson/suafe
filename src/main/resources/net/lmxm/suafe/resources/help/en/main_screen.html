<h1>Main Screen</h1>

<p>
The main screen consists of a toolbar and three tabs.

<ul>
<li><a href="toolbar.html">Toolbar</a></li>
<li><a href="users_tab.html">Users Tab</a></li>
<li><a href="groups_tab.html">Groups Tab</a></li>
<li><a href="access_rules_tab.html">Access Rules Tab</a></li>
</ul>

The toolbar provides quick access to general file actions as well as quick
access to add users, groups and access rules. Select one of the three tabs to
view and manipulate the lists of users, groups or access rules. The preview
button generates an authz file and displays it for your review. Changes to the 
contents of the preview window are not persisted; preview is for review only.
