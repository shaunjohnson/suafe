repositories and paths defined in the authorization file formatted as a tree. 
The right side displays all access rules for the item selected on in the tree. 
Selecting Server displays all access rules, including server level access rules.
Selecting a repository displays all access rules for that repository and 
selecting a path displays all access rules for the path.

buttons. These buttons change depending on the item selected in the tree. When
a repository item is selected the Edit Repository and Delete Repository action
buttons are available. WHen a path item is selected the Edit Path and Delete
Path action buttons are available. No actions are available when Server is
selected.

<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>
Editing or deleting a repository will modify or delete all access rules defined
for that repository. Editing or deleting a path will modify or delete all 
access rules defined for that path.
