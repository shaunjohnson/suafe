</ul>
</li>

<li>Fonts are now configurable. You're no longer limited to the default Java font. By default all values are displayed in a monospace font.</li>

<li>Window size, location and state as well as divider location are now saved when the application is closed. These saved settings can be cleared at anytime.</li>

<h2>Release 1.0.0 - 2007.01.27</h2>
<p>What's new in this release:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug: Allow deletion of server level access rules</li>
<li>Suafe starts maximized</li>
<li>All dialogs and the help screen can be closed with a hit of the escape key</li>
<li>Suafe now keeps track of changes that you make. It'll prompt you to
save the file before doing anything that would clear the memory like
closing the application</li>
<li>More help screens</li>
<li>Fixed bug with edit access rule</li>
<li>Fixed bug where the screens didn't change when using cursor keys</li>
<li>Widened the clone dialogs. Added an icon for the clone menu items</li>
<li>Corrected a problem with the resource files</li>
</ul>

<p>What's gone missing in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repository browser has been removed. This wasn't available so
nobody should miss it. Trouble getting the browser to work properly and
poor performance of the JavaSVN library lead me to remove this feature.
It is also something that isn't all that important; I don't think it
would be used much.</li>
<li>The print function was removed. Printing an authz file is
interesting, but again not important. It's more important to have a
good editor than to be able to print files which are unlikely to be
read by anybody.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release 0.4 - 2006.10.03</h2>
<p>What's gone missing in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the current file opened is changed then add an indicator to the title bar</li>
<li>Prompt user to save the current file if it contains unsaved changes when closing the window</li>
<li>Enlarged many of the screens so that long names and paths can be viewed in their entirety</li>
<li>Bug: Editing access rules and paths now works as expected</li>
<li>Added copyright to source</li>
<li>Updated to comply with Java 5 standards</li>
</ul>

<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installer isn't the greatest and isn't complete. Use at your own risk</li>
<li>The about screen still displays 0.3 even though this is the 0.4 release</li>
</ul>
